# Maybe it's JavaScript, maybe it's not...

For parsing a JavaScript-like variable declaration statement

### A declaration statement:
- begins with a keyword var, followed by one or more identifier(s).
- is white space insensitive
- ends with a semicolon (;)

### A group of identifiers:
- is preceded by a var keyword
- is delimited by commas
- is white space insensitive

### An identifier:
- can contains any number of digits, characters, and underscores in both lower and upper cases
- cannot start with a digit
- cannot contains any space

An identifier is a term, meaning it is an unbreakable piece of token. So are the var keywords and the semicolons.
